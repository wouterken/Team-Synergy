## About
The project aims to allow customers to manage URL's as bookmarks,
compose these into a structured list and then extract only the relevant content
to create a book. The book will be both viewable as pure HTML online,
or downloadable in the ePub e-book format.

The system will be hosted on a wordpress platform.
